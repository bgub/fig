## Add Payload routes to the TanStack Start adapter

`@bgub/fig-tanstack-start/payload` now exposes `payloadResource`, which compiles
an inline render callback into a private server function and Fig-owned route
data resource. Applications supply the cache key and component tree without
authoring transport plumbing. The shared declaration can stay in one
`.payload.tsx` module; its render callback and render-only imports are omitted
from the browser build. The initial SSR response is embedded into the document
and adopted without refetching; client navigation and refresh use the same
resource request path. Payload data rows
hydrate the shared store, asset resources are retained on their owning server
segments or inserted through the browser registry, and client references retain
their resolver-defined identity. `decodePayloadStream` and `payloadDataLoader`
now expose `retainAssets` for server document renderers that need this delivery
path.

`@bgub/fig-tanstack-start/server` exposes the lower-level
`renderPayloadResponse` used by the generated TanStack server function; it
defaults its render abort signal to the incoming request, so a disconnected
client cancels the Payload render. Shell
HTML streams while outlined Suspense holes settle, and the completed initial
responses are embedded before TanStack starts full-document hydration. The Vite
adapter also publishes assets imported only by server modules into the client
build output. Fig Router links also consume TanStack's `viewTransition`
navigation option without forwarding it as an invalid attribute to the rendered
anchor, and derive active state from the resolved route instead of an in-flight
location.
